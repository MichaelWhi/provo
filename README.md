ProVo
====

ProVo is a web application to showcase the projects at your organization / group.

You know...
----
* You wanna start a class/research project and wonder about getting data, current literature. Or you just wanna talk with an "expert" on this topic, who has some experience in that field.

  Whom should you contact?

* You wonder about using technology X (let's say: Hadoop). Is someone at your organization is already trying out or using it? Maybe there is some inofficial cluster around or somebody wrote something about the topic.

  But where would you find that person?

*ProVo* solves that!
---

You'd simply search for it or browse through the list of topics/tags. You would then find a short description, some links - and most important - a contact.

When you start a new project, you then would fill out a small form and enter or paste a summary to create a project. Less than 5 minutes and it's done.

ProVo will ask you after a while whether the info is still current and you're still working on the project.

And everyone will benefit! :-)

What dows ProVo stand for?

I had the idea very late and wasn't able to figure out that "ProVo" actually is not a good abbreviation for "PROject OVerview" ;-)
